            While HTML is the fundamental structure of every web page, it can be visually unappealing on its own. Cascading Style Sheets or CSS is a language web developers use to style the HTML content on a web page. If you’re interested in modifying colors, font types, font sizes, images, element positioning, and more, CSS is the tool for the job!
            In this lesson, you’ll learn how to set up your CSS file structure and select which HTML elements you wish to style.
            </p>
            <code> body { color: #red; display: inline-block; }</code>

        <p>The diagram on the right shows two different methods, or syntaxes, for writing CSS code. The first syntax shows CSS applies as a ruleset, while the second shows it written as an inline style. Two different methods of writing CSS may seem a bit intimidating at first, but it’s not as bad as it looks!
                The anatomy of both methods does share common features. Notice how both syntaxes contain a declaration. Declarations are the core of CSS. They apply a style to the selected element. Here, the <p> element has been selected in both syntaxes and will be styled to display the text in blue.
                Understanding that a declaration is used to style a selected element is key to learning how to style HTML documents with CSS! The terms below explain each of the labels in the diagram on the right.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Ruleset Terms:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="example">Selector—The beginning of the ruleset used to target the element that will be styled.</li>
            <code> a {}</code>
            <li class="example">The code in-between (and including) the curly braces ({ }) that contains the CSS declaration(s).</li>
            <code> a {background-img: url('java.jpeg');}</code>
            <li class="example">Declaration—The group name for a property and value pair that applies a style to the selected element.</li>
            <code>li { text-size: bold;}</code>
            <li class="example">Property—The first part of the declaration that signifies what visual characteristic of the element is to be modified.</li>
            <code>li {color: #red;}</code>
            <li class="example">Value—The second part of the declaration that signifies the value of the property.
            </li>
        </ul>

            <p> Before CSS, nearly all presentational attributes of HTML documents were contained within the HTML markup. All font colors, background styles, element alignments, borders, and sizes had to be explicitly described, often repeatedly, within the HTML. CSS lets authors move much of that information to another file, the style sheet, resulting in considerably simpler HTML.</p>
            <p> For example, headings (h1 elements), sub-headings (h2), sub-sub-headings (h3), etc., are defined structurally using HTML. In print and on the screen, choice of font, size, color and emphasis for these elements is presentational.</p>
            <p>Before CSS, document authors who wanted to assign such typographic characteristics to, say, all h2 headings had to repeat HTML presentational markup for each occurrence of that heading type. This made documents more complex, larger, and more error-prone and difficult to maintain. CSS allows the separation of presentation from structure.</p>
            <p>CSS can define color, font, text alignment, size, borders, spacing, layout and many other typographic characteristics, and can do so independently for on-screen and printed views.</p>
            <p>CSS also defines non-visual styles, such as reading speed and emphasis for aural text readers. The W3C has now deprecated the use of all presentational HTML markup.</p>

            <header>Examples</header>
            
            <p>For example, under pre-CSS HTML, a heading element defined with red text would be written as:</p>
        
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>
